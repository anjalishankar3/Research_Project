## New Year, New Flu Vaccine

# Author:
Anjali Shankar

# Abstract:
This research project is about looking into how the influenza virus is constantly changing and how that leads to a new flu vaccine each year. The influenza virus undergoes evolution often due to the antigenic drift and shift in their surface glycoproteins, specifically the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface proteins. In this project, I will look at how the main strains of influenza have evolved from each other by making a tree using representative sequences of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from each variety of influenza. The main question that is going to be addressed is how we can use the information about how influenza changes to improve influenza vaccines. 

# Outline:
Introduction:
  Background information about the virus
    Different types and strains of the influenza virus
    How are flu vaccines made

Methods:
  MAFFT: Multiple Sequence Alignment
    Created a fasta file with representative samples of different influenza strains and use MAFFT to see which parts of the hemagglutinin protein strains are more conserved
      These sequences were taken from the influenza reference database (IRD)
  ngphylogeny: Phylogenetic tree
    Use the tree to visualize the evolution of the different strains
  Mega: 
    Estimate subsitution matrix and find best model of evoluton
      Understand how the best model of evolution is then used to predict new influenza strains

Results: 
  Multiple Sequence Alignment 
  Phylogenetic Tree
  Subsitution Matrix
  Model of evolution
