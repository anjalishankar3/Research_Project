Bioinformatics Research Project on Influenza Strains

Abstract: This research project is about looking into how the influenza virus is constantly changing and how that leads to a new flu vaccine each year. The influenza virus undergoes evolution often due to the antigenic drift and shift in their surface glycoproteins, specifically the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface proteins. In this project, I will look at how the main strains of influenza have evolved from each other by making a tree using representative sequences of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from each variety of influenza. The main question that is going to be addressed is how we can use the information about how influenza changes to improve influenza vaccines.
